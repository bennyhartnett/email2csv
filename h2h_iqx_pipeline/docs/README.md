# Documentation

This directory contains design and process documentation for the pipeline.

- `architecture.md` – High-level technical architecture.
- `process_overview.md` – Step-by-step description of how the pipeline maps onto the existing manual process in Excel and IQX.

These documents are intended for engineers and stakeholders who want to understand how the prototype works and how it can evolve (e.g., adding email integration, browser automation, or LLM-based enrichment later).
